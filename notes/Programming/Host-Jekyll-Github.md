People have been asking me about this cool blogging website that I created a couple weeks ago.

Here, I will share with you on how I put up this website.

The truth is that I didn't build the website from scratch. The entire scripts/codes for this website are written by [Hydejack](https://www.hydejack.com). Hydejack allows its users to use their creation for free with limited features. However, features such as resume builder, newsletter box, and project sorting are available for $59. For my blogging purpose, I'm going to stick with the free version for the website.

The website is a static site—the most basic type of website which delivers to the user exactly as stored; a static website is one that is usually written in plain HTML In contrast, A dynamic website is written using a server-side scripting language like PHP, ASP, JSP, or Coldfusion; one can create a dynamically interactive user interface with a dynamic web pages. 

Jekyll is a static web pages generator for personal, project, or organization sites and it is written in Ruby. It's great for bloggin purposes. Hydejack created a theme based on the Jekyll platform. You can find it [here](https://rubygems.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=jekyll-theme). 

Nevertheless, you can find many beautiful Jekyll themes in [Ruby Gem](https://rubygems.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=jekyll+theme). If you click on one of the theme, there usually is a link to the homepage of the theme. Often, it will lead you to a Github page. On the Github page, you can find the installation guide. In the case of Hydejack, you can find their easy installation guide in [this website](https://github.com/qwtel/hydejack-starter-kit).

Once you had created all the necessary scripts for a webpage, you must find a server to host it. A GitHub user is allowed to host their webpage on GitHub for free.

There you have it!

It's easy to create a Jekyll website and host it on GitHub.

Now, you can customize your own static site by tweaking the _config.yml.

This will be a topic for another time!
