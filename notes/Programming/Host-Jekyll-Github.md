People have been asking me about this cool blogging website that I created a couple weeks ago.

Here, I would like to share with you on how I put up this website.

The truth is that I didn't build the current website. The entire scripts of this website is written by [this guy](https://www.hydejack.com). Hydejack build up a Jekyll theme, meaning they build a static website through Jekyll with a unique theme. There are two main types of website: static and dynamic. A static website is one that is usually written in plain HTML and what is in the code of Jekyll displayed to the user. A dynamic website is written using a server-side scripting language like PHP, ASP, JSP, or Coldfusion.

What I did was picking up a theme build by Hydejack which you can find it [here](https://rubygems.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=jekyll-theme). In Ruby Gem, you can find many pretty Jekyll-theme that other people built, and host in GitHub as your blogging website. If you click on a theme, there usually is a link to the homepage of the theme. Often, it will lead you to a Github page. On the Github page, you can find the installation guide. In the case of Hydejack, you can find their installation guide in [this website](https://github.com/qwtel/hydejack-starter-kit).

There are two ways to host it up. The first is through a locally hosting site, and the second way directly host your website from Github page. I personally prefer the 2nd way because it is much easier.
