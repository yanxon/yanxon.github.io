Today, I start this blog to document about my journey. This will be the most important writing that will ever be posted, at the same time the most trivial one since this is the **FIRST STEP**! **I lied!** The **"FIRST STEP"** will be creating this website and put it up in the internet, but the **"FIRST STEP"** to you viewer will be this writing.

I'm currently 26 years old as I write this. In the two years, I will be completing my Ph.D. study in condensed matter physics (mostly solid materials) from University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV). Precisely, I am using machine learning algorithm to predict materials' properties. To do this, I'm mentored by Dr. Qiang Zhu (http://www.physics.unlv.edu/~qzhu/).

In Dr. Zhu's group, we work together around the clock as if a startup company since Dr. Zhu is a new hired faculty in the UNLV physics department. We have to find funding source from various agencies. Here, I learn how to ask for money by selling yourself. Since we have a limited resources, we become resourceful in everything we do. We do what we do best with everything we've got. I have to say I couldn't be happier working in his group because everything we do aligns with my future plans.

About my near future plans, I want to get experience working in a blue-chip tech company for a couple years after my graduation. Why does it has to be two years? It doesn't. I prefer to lock in my financial security and go on a riskier venture like a startup company. If I have to build a startup company all over again, I am well equipped.

May this blog be useful to you.
