I am going to tell you about my experience with Ubuntu v15.04 and v18.04.

I have been using Ubuntu(Linux Os) since 2015. The newest version of Ubuntu was v15.04 at the time. It worked pretty good for programming purposes. About 4 months ago, I needed to use Git since I was constantly git clone and push to my page. I couldn't install the Git for some reason.

Now, I have more time to look for the reasons. I spent three days trying to figure it out. The reason Git couldn't be install is due to the outdated Ubuntu v15.04. The updater in Ubuntu v15.04 didn't even want to update itself. So, I spent time to find out why and how to update the updater. In this case, the time spent was unproductive and unsuccessful.

$$Therefore, I implore you stop using Ubuntu v15.04.$$ If you have one installed in your computer, delete it! You can go to YouTube to find out how to delete Ubuntu in your system. It was pretty easy.

However, Ubuntu 18.04 is a much better Linux OS in term of. Um... Everything. The GUI is better customized, and Git was successfully installed without any problem. I just had it installed in my computer 5 hours ago; I can tell I will be using Ubuntu v18.04 for a long time. Also, Ubuntu v.18.04 has a Long Term Support (LTS). It has supports guaranteed until April 2023.

At some point, you have to evaluate yourself and question whether your hard work is going to pay off or not. If not, you have to find a better way to accomplish your goal. In this case, my goal was to install Git on my Ubuntu system. Instead of spending all the unproductive hours, I could of start with uninstalling Ubuntu 15 and installing Ubuntu 18. Then, I found out that Ubuntu 18 is so much better than the previous version. Sometimes, the things that didn't happen is the best things that never happened.

Anyway, I hope this article save you time if you encounter the same problem as me. Just abandon Ubuntu v.15.04!
