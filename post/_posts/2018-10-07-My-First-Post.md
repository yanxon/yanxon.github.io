Today, I start documenting my career pathway.

I'm 26 years old as I write this post. In two years, I wish to complete my PhD study in computational condensed matter physics at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Precisely, my research is utilizing machine learning techniques and first principle calculations for predicting novel renewable and sustainable materials. My PhD advisor, [Dr. Qiang Zhu](http://www.physics.unlv.edu/~qzhu/), advised me to write a blog because it is important to share my experience which I've learned from research. Since HR nowadays likes to hire employees through social media such as GitHub and LinkedIn, this blog will increase my chance of exposure to industry.

At this point, I have decided to join the industrial space, particularly, in technology once I graduated. **I am inspired to be the king of technology.** As the king of technology, I can serve the humanity through innovating functional technologies to help the lifes of billions of people on the planet earth. I envision a sustainable world where a generation is always improving for the sake of the next generations. With that being said, the world I picture involves safe artificial intelligence (AI) and clean, renewable, and sustainable energy. Most importantly, the history of education needs a new trajectory.

The current educational system does not support the future world that involves AI. Many schools don't provide the opportunity for the students to familiarized themselves with the emerging technology, especially in the third world countries. The students nowadays still learn the multiplication table whereas a computer can easily do this many times faster. Although I don't know how to revolutionalize this educational arena yet, I will figure out while documenting on this blog.

I wish this blog can be useful to you and will make you realize that there is no overnight success. As JFK said, "We choose to go to the Moon! We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win, and the others, too."

Now, it's the time to shutout the opposing voices and embrace my believe.
