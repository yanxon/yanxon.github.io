What is the big idea behind the Finite Element Method?

> The Finite Element Method is a way to turn a partial differential equation
> into a collection of algebraic equations.

How is that helpful? Why would I want to trade in one type of equation for another?

> Algebraic equations are fundamentally easier to understand and solve.
>  
> The theory of directly solving partial differential equations is **limited
> to simple problems** with highly symmetric domains and boundary conditions.
> 
> However, algebraic equations are well-understood and are **easily solved by computers**.

Why should I consider finite elements instead of finite differences, finite volumes, etc?

> * Generality: FEM applies to many different disciplines
> * Geometry: FEM works well with complicated geometries
> * Efficiency: FEM produces sparse systems of equations that are easy to solve
